### Overview
Mia is PhD student using functional genomics to understand fatty acid synthesis in Brassica oilseed species, which include crops such as canola. Mia uses a combination of bioinformatics and molecular biology to study the genetic underpinnings that determine erucic acid content in the seed oil, a very-long-chain fatty acid ideal for biofuel production. Her work aims to increase the erucic acid content in the seed oil of Brassica species to develop biofuel feedstocks that use limited resources such as water and land more efficiently.

### Education
