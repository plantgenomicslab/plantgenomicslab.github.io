### Overview
I am Sang-min Chung, a senior professor at Dongguk University's Plant Molecular Genetic Physiology Lab. My work is a place that deals with the fusion and complex studies of plant physiology and molecular genetics. Plants according to the flow and regulation of genetic information according to the genetics and mutations at the molecular level by matching the unique phenomena and properties of plant functions, development, and growth, etc. study the changes in In addition to searching for genes underlying specific phenotypes and physiological phenomena of plants, we are contributing a lot to the development of new crop species by selecting the genes as markers for molecular breeding.
